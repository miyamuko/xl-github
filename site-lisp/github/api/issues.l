              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

; Where 'state' is either 'open' or 'closed'.

; For example, to search for 'test' in the open issues for defunkt/github-issues repo, you can do this:

;     $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/json/issues/search/defunkt/github-issues/open/test
;     {

;;; ### List a Project's Issues ###

; To see a list of issues for a project,

(defun list-issues (user repo state-or-label &key label callback nomsg)
  (funcall (if label
               'list-issues-by-label
             'list-issues-by-state)
           user repo state-or-label :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

(defun list-issues-by-state (user repo state &key callback nomsg)
  (validate-state state)
  (github-get "issues/list/:user/:repo/:state"
              :uri-params (list user repo state)
              :return-type '(:root "issues" :list t :object t :type issue)
              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

; where :state is either 'open' or 'closed'.  You can also search with a label:

(defun list-issues-by-label (user repo label &key callback nomsg)
  (github-get "issues/list/:user/:repo/label/:label"
              :uri-params (list user repo label)
              :return-type '(:root "issues" :list t :object t :type issue)
              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

; For example, to see all the open issues I have on the schacon/simplegit project, we can run

;     $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/yaml/issues/list/schacon/simplegit/open

;;; ### View an Issue ###

; To get data on an individual issue by number, run

(defun show-issue (user repo number &key callback nomsg)
  (github-get "issues/show/:user/:repo/:number"
              :uri-params (list user repo number)
              :return-type '(:root "issue" :list nil :object t :type issue)
              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

; So to get all the data for a issue #1 in our repo, we can run something like this:

;     $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/yaml/issues/show/schacon/simplegit/1
;     ---

;;; ### List an Issue's Comments ###

; To get a list of comments made on an issue, run

              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

; So to get all the comments for a issue #1 in our repo, we can run something like this:

;     $ curl http://github.com/api/v2/yaml/issues/comments/schacon/simplegit/open
;     ---
;     comments:
;     - created_at: 2010-02-08 12:54:54 -08:00

;;; ### Open and Close Issues ###

; To open a new issue on a project, make a authorized POST to

(defun open-issue (user repo title body &key callback nomsg)
  (form-value-bind (data)
      (progn
        (form "title" title t)
        (form "body" body t))
    (github-post "issues/open/:user/:repo"
                 :uri-params (list user repo)
                 :return-type '(:root "issue" :list nil :object t :type issue)
                 :data data
                 :callback callback :nomsg nomsg)))

; Where you can provide POST variables:

;     title
;     body

; It will return the data for the newly created ticket if it is successful.  You need to provide your username and token so the system knows who you are and can assign you as the opener of the issue.

; For example, I could open a new issue on my simplegit project like this:

;     $ curl -F 'login=schacon' -F 'token=XXX' -F 'title=new' -F 'body=my ticket' \
;       http://github.com/api/v2/yaml/issues/open/schacon/simplegit
;     ---
;     issue:
;       user: schacon
;       gravatar_id: 9375a9529679f1b42b567a640d775e7d
;       body: my ticket
;       title: new
;       number: 1
;       votes: 0
;       state: open

; To close or reopen an issue, you just need to supply the issue number

(defun close-issue (user repo number &key callback nomsg)
  (github-get "issues/close/:user/:repo/:number"
              :uri-params (list user repo number)
              :return-type '(:root "issue" :list nil :object t :type issue)
              :send-login-token t
              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

(defun reopen-issue (user repo number &key callback nomsg)
  (github-get "issues/reopen/:user/:repo/:number"
              :uri-params (list user repo number)
              :return-type '(:root "issue" :list nil :object t :type issue)
              :send-login-token t
              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

; You need to be logged in via token as well.  Here is how I would close the ticket I opened earlier:

;     $ curl -F 'login=schacon' -F 'token=XXX' \
;       http://github.com/api/v2/yaml/issues/close/schacon/simplegit/1
;     ---
;     issue:
;       user: schacon
;       gravatar_id: 9375a9529679f1b42b567a640d775e7d
;       body:
;       title: new
;       number: 1
;       votes: 0
;       state: closed

;;; ### Edit Existing Issues ###

; For the final three calls (edit, label add and label delete) you have to be authorized a collaborator on the project.

; To edit an existing issue, you can POST to

(defun update-issue (user repo number title body &key callback nomsg)
  (form-value-bind (data)
      (progn
        (form "title" title t)
        (form "body" body t))
    (github-post "issues/edit/:user/:repo/:number"
                 :uri-params (list user repo number)
                 :return-type '(:root "issue" :list nil :object t :type issue)
                 :data data
                 :callback callback :nomsg nomsg)))

; Where you can provide POST variables:

;     title
;     body

; This will overwrite the title or body of the issue, if you are authorized member of the project.

;;; ### Listing Labels ###

; You can list available labels for a projects issues with

(defun list-issue-labels (user repo &key callback nomsg)
  (github-get "issues/labels/:user/:repo"
              :uri-params (list user repo)
              :return-type '(:root "labels" :list t :object nil)
              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

; For example,

;     $ curl -F 'login=schacon' -F 'token=XXX' https://github.com/api/v2/yaml/issues/labels/schacon/simplegit
;     ---
;     labels:
;     - label1
;     - label2

;;; ### Add and Remove Labels ###

; To add a label, run

(defun add-issue-label (user repo label number &key callback nomsg)
  (github-get "issues/label/add/:user/:repo/:label/:number"
              :uri-params (list user repo label number)
              :return-type '(:root "labels" :list t :object nil)
              :send-login-token t
              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

; This will return a list of the labels currently on that issue, your new one included. If the label is not yet in the system, it will be created.

; Here is how I would add the label 'testing' to my first ticket in my simplegit project:

;     $ curl -F 'login=schacon' -F 'token=XXX' https://github.com/api/v2/yaml/issues/label/add/schacon/simplegit/testing/1
;     ---
;     labels:
;     - testing
;     - test_label


; To remove a label, run:

(defun delete-issue-label (user repo label number &key callback nomsg)
  (github-get "issues/label/remove/:user/:repo/:label/:number"
              :uri-params (list user repo label number)
              :return-type '(:root "labels" :list t :object nil)
              :send-login-token t
              :callback callback :nomsg nomsg))

; Again, it will return a list of the labels currently on the issue.

; You can also add and remove labels generally by leaving off the Issue number.
; That will add a label to the system but not attach it to an issue, or remove
; an issue from all labels.

;;; ### Comment on Issues ###

; You can comment on issues at

(defun add-issue-comment (user repo number comment &key callback nomsg)
  (form-value-bind (data)
      (form "comment" comment t)
    (github-post "issues/comment/:user/:repo/:number"
                 :uri-params (list user repo number)
                 :return-type '(:root "labels" :list t :object nil :type issue-comment)
                 :data data
                 :callback callback :nomsg nomsg)))

; Simply send it a 'comment' POST variable with the comment you'd like to make.  It will attribute the comment to the user that is authenticated.  Here is an example:

;     $ curl -F 'login=schacon' -F 'token=XXX' -F 'comment=this is amazing' \
;     https://github.com/api/v2/json/issues/comment/defunkt/dunder-mifflin/1
;     {"comment": {"gravatar_id": "9375a9529679f1b42b567a640d775e7d",
;     "user": "schacon", "body": "this is amazing", id: 17,
;     created_at: TIMESTAMP, updated_at: TIMESTAMP}
